• How to use JavaScript Output method? 
Ans: In JavaScript, there are several methods you can use to output or display information. The most common methods for outputting data in JavaScript are:

-Using the console.log() method:

console.log("Hello, World!");

The console.log() method is used to display messages or values in the console of your web browser's developer tools. It's primarily used for debugging and development purposes.

-Writing to the HTML document:
You can write output directly to the HTML document by targeting an element and modifying its content. For example, you can use the innerHTML property to modify the content of an HTML element:

<div id="output"></div>
var outputElement = document.getElementById("output");
outputElement.innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
This method allows you to update the content of an element on the web page itself.

-Using the alert() method:
The alert() method displays a popup dialog box with the specified message.

alert("Hello, World!");
This method is useful for simple notifications or displaying information in a modal-like window.

-Writing to the browser's document:
You can also write directly to the document using the document.write() method. However, note that using document.write() after the page has finished loading can overwrite the entire document, so it's not commonly used in modern web development.

document.write("Hello, World!");


• How to use JavaScript Events? Give examples.
Ans: JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen within the browser, such as a button click, a key press, or the page finishing loading. You can use JavaScript to respond to these events and execute specific code when they occur. Here are some examples of how to use JavaScript events:

	1. Button Click Event:

	var button = document.getElementById("myButton");
	button.addEventListener("click", function() {
 	 alert("Button clicked!");
	});

	2. Key Press Event:

	var input = document.getElementById("myInput");
	input.addEventListener("keypress", function(event) {
  	console.log("Key pressed: " + event.key);
	});

	3. Page Load Event:
	window.addEventListener("load", function() {
  	console.log("Page loaded!");
	});

	4. Mouseover Event:
	var element = document.getElementById("myElement");
	element.addEventListener("mouseover", function() {
  	element.style.backgroundColor = "red";
	});

	5. Form Submit Event:
	var form = document.getElementById("myForm");
	form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
  	event.preventDefault();
  	var name = document.getElementById("nameInput").value;
  	console.log("Form submitted with name: " + name);
	});

	6. Window Resize Event:
	window.addEventListener("resize", function() {
 	console.log("Window resized");
	});
